# Remix Bit.dev Clone

This is a clone of [bit.dev](https://bit.dev) that was build using [Remix.run](https://remix.run) framework

This demo not 100% functional beacuse i don't know the underline tech bit.dev uses.

so some things are working some aren't.

also this clone is only for the Front UI so no backend stuff, well just simple things I didn't want this clone to be complex, maybe i will implement all the Remix actions and loaders for the routes but for now most of the routes have loaders and not actions.

## The TechStack
Remix as framework

Prisma as ORM 

Postgres as database

Express as backend server

Tailwindcss as css framework

### This is still work in progress, so don't panic if something breaks...
